# AR-Navigation-App
[Location Based Augmented Reality Navigation Application,IJSRCSEIT,MAY 2019](https://ijsrcseit.com/CSEIT195340)

# Inspiration
The problem occuring in traditional mapping is not proper 
direction representation. A traditional map cannot provide a proper view for instance if there is a flyover and a 
road below it, traditional map cannot differentiate between them and will show both as a single blue line (path) 
which will confuse the user which way to go. 

# What it does?
This problem can be solved as we would be providing a 3D view . Along with a generous assistant which will help the user in interactive manner. The assistant will direct the user till the actual destination which will solve our above problem whether to take flyover or the road??It will also give information about the places nearby in the route with their details.
Augmented Reality Navigation App created using Unity3D and Google ARCore. This App provides navigation with the help of Camera and a virtual 3D object which will guide us to our destination in a user friendly way.
